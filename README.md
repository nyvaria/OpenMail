OpenMail plugin for Bukkit
=====
Original plugin by safoo, continued by Iaccidentally, and then continued again by captbunzo.

My aims with this version are a few fold. First, I plan to refactor the code to split things up into a few separate classes and to use some classes I use for commands, etc. Also, I am switching from a command of /mailbox to a simplier command of /mail.

I greatly appreciate the work of safoo and Iaccidentally and hope to do this next version justice.
